# Autonomous-Racing-with-Q-Learning

## AI Anarchy

This program is designed to be run on Unity. 

The main menu screen will be presented first. The user can select either the Start button or the AI Console button. The start button will allow the user to control the car movements using the arrow keys. The forward and backward keys will allow the car to move forward or reverse. The left and right arrow keys will allow the user to move left and right. 

If the user chooses the AI Console, the car will move on its own. The car is essentially training itself to drive around the track in a reasonable amount of time. This mode requires a server. 


In either mode, the user can press P to pause the game which will also stop all music. From the pause menu, the user can exit to the main menu where they can choose a different mode.
